CHANGELOG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


2014_06_15

General:

	* Moved lua files to "modfiles" directory
	* Created README.txt
	* Created changelog.txt



depends.txt:

	* Added wool as a soft-dependency. It's a default mod in minetest_game
	but with the new sub-games being all the rage now, who knows if wool
	will be included in them. If not, some of the crafting recipes will
	be broken so you'll have to use either the "give" command, play in
	creative-mode, or have the creative priv and Unified Inventory.



init.lua:

	* The "tools.lua" file was removed because, other than a comment, it
	was empty.
	* The "tools.lua" dofile line was removed from this file.
	* Lua files moved to "modfiles" directory and links edited accordingly.



crafts.lua:

	* Cheapened the crafting recipe for emergency phones. They were too
	expensive and provided too little heart-point boost for their expense
	that player the very, very few players who crafted them regretted it.
	Emergency phones became one of the most *undesirable* items on our
	server.
	* Removed the chat messages and coord announcement. Most players, on our
	server, don't want their coordinates broadcast and the heart-point line
	above the hot-bar is enough to see the increase in health.
	* The recuperative powers of the emgergency phone were too limited.
	Couple that with the very expensive crafting recipe and the emergency
	phone was just not worth it. So I removed the minimum heart-point
	requirement and boosted the heart-point increase to full-recovery.
	* Increased the light output to 14. Hey, it's an emergency! ;)-



nodes.lua:

	* Updated the code a bit. Replaced "tiles" with "tiles"
	* Added sounds (default stone)
	* Added screwdriver compatibility to manholes.
	* Added low-level light to asphalt stuff so roads are easier to see
	at night. Pretend it's the reflective yellow and white road paint
	shining in your headlights.
	* Emergency Phone - Disabled the minimal heart-point requirement,
	increased the heart-point boost to full recovery, made them diggable by
	all tools. In their original configuration, the recipe was too expensive
	and the health boost to little that they quickly became an undesireable
	item. Nobody wanted them.

	POSSIBLE FUTURE CHANGES

	* Make asphalt stuff even harder to dig.
	I had considered adding all tools, breakable by	hand and making all
	asphalt stuff easy to dig but after counciling with one of our
	moderators it seemed better to leave the asphalt difficult to dig as a
	way to annoy griefers. Road builders on our server will have supplies
	to offset the extra difficulty of digging asphalt stuff. Roadwork is
	very important and needs to be encouraged. Making asphalt stuff
	difficult to dig may go against that encouragement. Roads are difficult
	to set protection on because they cut through so many players areas
	and builds. If the asphalt stuff were made as hard as possible, that
	would at least slow-up any attempts to grief the roads by digging them.
	Time and experimentation will tell. Eventually we'll find the right
	combination mateiral hardness and ease of use. To make any node as
	difficult as possible to dig, limit the groups to only one tool and
	increase the level of difficulty to 1.

settings.lua:

	* Removed the heart-point settings since they are hard-set in the nodes'
	definition now.
