##### LazyJ's Fork of a very old version of webdesigner97's "Streets" Mod

This version of 'Streets' is based off of one of webdesigner97's releases
sometime around 2013_04.

At LinuxGaming.us, we have been using the same release of "Streets" since the
spring of 2013. With a few little tweaks, this smaller, simpler version has met
and exceeded all our road-making needs, then and now.

Maybe there are other servers and players who would like to have basic, modern-
looking roads for their worlds without a lot of extras. If so, this mod may just
be the ticket.

The newer versions of "Streets" are feature-rich and excellent. If you want to
create super highways and have various forms of infrastructure, I encourage
you to check the newer, full-featured versions of webdesigner97's latest work
on "Streets":
